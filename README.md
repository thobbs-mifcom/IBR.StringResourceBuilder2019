# IBR.StringResourceBuilder2019

## This is a update of IBR.StringResourceBuilder2011 to bring it into VisualStudio 2019
There are big differences between VS 2019 and VS 2022 when it comes to Extensions.
Since I do not have the Key files (they are understandably not in the repo) I cannot publish this updated Extension to Microsoft.
But you should be able to build and run it with Visual Studio 2019. Since you can open a VS 2022 Solution in VS 2019 you can then use this tool on your 2022 solution.


The String Resource Builder is a Visual Studio (VS) extension to extract string literals (C#, VB.NET) from source code into resource files (ResX).

## See the [documentation](/docs/Documentation.md) for more information.

The binary of this VS extension is also published at the [VisualStudio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/74ecfb4f-6245-4942-a5b2-67aaacd49415) for direct access from VS.
